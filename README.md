Rabbit addon for Grasshopper by Morphocode
==========================================
RABBIT is a plug-in for McNeelâ€™s Grasshopper that simulates biological and physical processes.

Rabbit provides an easy way to explore natural phenomena such as pattern formation, self-organization and emergence. The add-on gives architects and designers the opportunity to integrate these models of organization in their own designs.
